# Scrape historical EPS data

Download historical earnings-per-share data for stock tickers.

Usage: 
  1. Enter the stock tickers (one per line) in symbols.txt.  
  2. run the script: `casperjs getEPS.js`

This does not currently do anything with the data, it just prints it to the console.

Dependencies: casperjs + phantomjs
