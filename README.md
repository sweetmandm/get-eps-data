# Scrape historical EPS data

Download historical earnings-per-share data for stock tickers.

Usage: 
  1. Enter the stock tickers (one per line) in symbols.txt.  
  2. run the script: `casperjs getEPS.js`

This will put the raw data in one csv file and put the average of the eps values in another csv file.
The current data source (Morningstar) only seems to include data for whole years, not quarterly reports (though it does have TTM, which is not included in the average calculated for the report generated by this script).

Dependencies: casperjs + phantomjs
